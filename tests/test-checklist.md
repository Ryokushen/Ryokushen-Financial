# Manual Testing Checklist & Code Analysis

## Test Execution Instructions

1. Start the local server: `python3 server.py` (runs on port 8080)
2. Open the application in Chrome: `http://localhost:8080/index.html`
3. Open Chrome DevTools Console (F12 or Cmd+Option+J)
4. Available manual testing utilities:
   - `window.dashboardUtils.captureSnapshot()` - Test financial snapshot capture
   - `window.searchTransactions({criteria})` - Test transaction search
   - Various module-specific testing functions

### TransactionManager Tests
1. Open `/tests/unit/transaction-manager-test.html` in browser
2. Tests run automatically on page load
3. Verifies:
   - Initialization
   - Atomic add/update/delete with balance updates
   - Batch operations
   - Validation
   - Cache functionality

## Issues Found During Code Analysis

### 1. Accounts Module
- [x] Form validation appears to be working based on `validateAccountForm()` in accounts.js
- [x] Initial balance transaction creation is handled correctly
- [ ] **ISSUE**: No duplicate account name validation found in code

### 2. Transactions Module  
- [x] Transaction form validation includes required fields
- [x] Debt category shows/hides debt account dropdown correctly
- [x] Balance calculations use caching for performance
- [x] **NEW**: TransactionManager provides centralized transaction management
- [x] **NEW**: Atomic operations with automatic rollback support
- [x] **NEW**: Batch transaction operations for imports
- [ ] **ISSUE**: No validation for future dates beyond reasonable range

### 3. Debt Module
- [x] Interest rate validation (0-100%) is implemented
- [x] Credit limit field only shows for credit cards
- [x] Payoff strategies (Avalanche/Snowball) implemented
- [ ] **ISSUE**: Due date validation only checks 1-31, doesn't account for month length

### 4. Recurring Bills Module
- [x] Frequency calculations for next due date working
- [x] Payment method switching between cash/credit implemented
- [x] Bill payment creates transactions correctly
- [ ] **ISSUE**: No validation to prevent paying bills too far in future

### 5. Investments Module
- [x] Stock symbol uppercase conversion implemented
- [x] Holdings value calculations working
- [x] Savings goals can be linked to accounts
- [ ] **ISSUE**: API key for stock prices may not be configured

### 6. TransactionManager Module (NEW)
- [x] Centralized transaction management with singleton pattern
- [x] Atomic operations with automatic rollback on failure
- [x] Smart caching with 5-minute TTL
- [x] Event batching for performance (50ms delay)
- [x] Batch operations for bulk imports (CSV, JSON, QIF)
- [x] Transaction validation and data preparation
- [x] Balance update tracking and reversal
- [x] Integration with EventManager for proper cleanup
- [x] Export functionality in multiple formats
- [x] Search and statistics capabilities

### 7. Cross-Module Interactions
- [x] Account deletion cascades to transactions
- [x] Debt payments link to transactions
- [x] Recurring bills create transactions
- [x] **NEW**: TransactionManager handles all transaction operations atomically
- [ ] **ISSUE**: No check for circular dependencies

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Add duplicate name validation** for accounts, debt accounts, and investment accounts
2. **Improve date validations** to prevent unreasonable future dates
3. **Add month-aware due date validation** for debt accounts
4. **Add API key configuration check** with user-friendly error message
5. **Add dependency checks** before allowing deletions

## Performance Observations

- Balance calculations are cached which is good
- Charts are destroyed before recreation to prevent memory leaks
- Transaction filtering could benefit from indexing for large datasets

## Security Observations

- Input sanitization using `escapeHtml()` function
- No SQL injection risk (using Supabase parameterized queries)
- API keys should be moved to environment variables

## Mobile Testing Notes

- Recent CSS fixes addressed overflow issues
- Chart heights are constrained on mobile
- Touch events properly handled
- Tab navigation scrollable on small screens
