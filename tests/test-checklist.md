# Manual Testing Checklist & Code Analysis

## Test Execution Instructions

1. Open the application in Chrome: `/Users/charlesdorfeuille/Documents/GitHub/Ryokushen-Financial/index.html`
2. Open Chrome DevTools Console (Cmd+Option+J)
3. The test runner is now loaded. Execute tests by running:
   - `testRunner.runAllTests()` - Run all tests
   - `testRunner.testAccountsModule()` - Test only Accounts
   - etc.

## Issues Found During Code Analysis

### 1. Accounts Module
- [x] Form validation appears to be working based on `validateAccountForm()` in accounts.js
- [x] Initial balance transaction creation is handled correctly
- [ ] **ISSUE**: No duplicate account name validation found in code

### 2. Transactions Module  
- [x] Transaction form validation includes required fields
- [x] Debt category shows/hides debt account dropdown correctly
- [x] Balance calculations use caching for performance
- [ ] **ISSUE**: No validation for future dates beyond reasonable range

### 3. Debt Module
- [x] Interest rate validation (0-100%) is implemented
- [x] Credit limit field only shows for credit cards
- [x] Payoff strategies (Avalanche/Snowball) implemented
- [ ] **ISSUE**: Due date validation only checks 1-31, doesn't account for month length

### 4. Recurring Bills Module
- [x] Frequency calculations for next due date working
- [x] Payment method switching between cash/credit implemented
- [x] Bill payment creates transactions correctly
- [ ] **ISSUE**: No validation to prevent paying bills too far in future

### 5. Investments Module
- [x] Stock symbol uppercase conversion implemented
- [x] Holdings value calculations working
- [x] Savings goals can be linked to accounts
- [ ] **ISSUE**: API key for stock prices may not be configured

### 6. Cross-Module Interactions
- [x] Account deletion cascades to transactions
- [x] Debt payments link to transactions
- [x] Recurring bills create transactions
- [ ] **ISSUE**: No check for circular dependencies

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Add duplicate name validation** for accounts, debt accounts, and investment accounts
2. **Improve date validations** to prevent unreasonable future dates
3. **Add month-aware due date validation** for debt accounts
4. **Add API key configuration check** with user-friendly error message
5. **Add dependency checks** before allowing deletions

## Performance Observations

- Balance calculations are cached which is good
- Charts are destroyed before recreation to prevent memory leaks
- Transaction filtering could benefit from indexing for large datasets

## Security Observations

- Input sanitization using `escapeHtml()` function
- No SQL injection risk (using Supabase parameterized queries)
- API keys should be moved to environment variables

## Mobile Testing Notes

- Recent CSS fixes addressed overflow issues
- Chart heights are constrained on mobile
- Touch events properly handled
- Tab navigation scrollable on small screens
