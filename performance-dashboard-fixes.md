# Performance Dashboard Module Loading Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unused Static Import (app.js)
- Removed the static import of performanceDashboard from app.js since it was never used
- This eliminates potential confusion and reduces bundle size

### 2. Enhanced Module Loading with Error Handling (ui.js)
- Added Chart.js availability check before attempting to load the dashboard
- Implemented a retry mechanism with timeout for Chart.js loading
- Added comprehensive debug logging at each step
- Improved error messages for better user feedback
- Added proper Promise handling for the init() method

### 3. Improved Dashboard Initialization (performanceDashboard.js)
- Added check to prevent double initialization
- Added DOM element verification before setup
- Enhanced error handling with proper error propagation
- Added global window reference for debugging
- Better logging throughout the initialization process

## Debugging Steps

To debug the performance dashboard loading, follow these steps:

1. **Open Browser Console**
   - Clear the console
   - Enable "Preserve log" to keep messages across page loads

2. **Navigate to Performance Tab**
   - Click on the "Analytics/Performance" tab
   - Watch for console messages

3. **Expected Console Output**
   ```
   Switching to performance tab...
   Chart.js now available, proceeding with dashboard init (or waiting message)
   Performance dashboard module loaded successfully
   Initializing performance dashboard...
   Initializing Performance Dashboard
   Chart.js available at init: true
   Chart.js available after load: true
   Performance Dashboard initialization complete
   Performance dashboard initialized successfully
   ```

4. **Check Global Variables**
   ```javascript
   // In console, check:
   console.log('Chart.js loaded:', !!window.Chart);
   console.log('Dashboard instance:', window.performanceDashboard);
   console.log('Dashboard initialized:', !!window.performanceDashboard.refreshInterval);
   ```

5. **Common Issues and Solutions**

   **Issue: "Chart.js not loaded yet, waiting..."**
   - Solution: Wait up to 5 seconds for automatic retry
   - If it fails, check network tab for CDN loading issues

   **Issue: "Missing required DOM elements"**
   - Solution: Check if the HTML structure matches expected IDs
   - Required elements: metrics-view, charts-view, performanceChart, main-chart-container

   **Issue: "Failed to load performance dashboard module"**
   - Solution: Check for syntax errors in performanceDashboard.js
   - Check network tab for 404 errors on module loading

## Testing the Fix

1. **Hard Refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Click** on the Analytics/Performance tab
3. **Wait** for initialization (should take less than 2 seconds)
4. **Verify** that metrics and charts are displayed

## Additional Debugging Commands

```javascript
// Force re-initialization (useful for testing)
window.performanceDashboard.destroy();
window.performanceDashboard.init();

// Check current state
console.log({
  chartInstance: window.performanceDashboard.chartInstance,
  currentView: window.performanceDashboard.currentView,
  isLoading: window.performanceDashboard.isLoading,
  data: window.performanceDashboard.data
});

// Manually trigger chart rendering
window.performanceDashboard.switchDashboardView('charts');
```

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. Check for JavaScript errors in other modules that might interfere
2. Verify that transactionManager is properly initialized (required dependency)
3. Check browser compatibility with dynamic imports
4. Look for Content Security Policy issues blocking CDN resources
5. Test in different browsers to isolate browser-specific issues
