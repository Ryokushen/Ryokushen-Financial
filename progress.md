### Context:
This session focused on fixing two major UX issues that were impacting user experience. The tab refresh issue was causing the application to reload unnecessarily when users switched browser tabs or mobile apps, disrupting their workflow. The scrolling issue was causing the page to jump when clicking anywhere, making the application feel broken. Both issues have been successfully resolved with targeted fixes that maintain all existing functionality while improving the user experience.

### Technical Details:
- Modified `js/modules/supabaseAuth.js` to track previous user ID
- Updated `js/app.js` with global click event handler
- Enhanced `js/modules/ui.js` switchTab function
- Added scroll prevention CSS in `styles.css`
