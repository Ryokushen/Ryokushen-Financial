## 2025-07-18 Session Summary

### Accomplishments:
- Fixed Supabase authentication tab refresh issue
  - Implemented smart auth state detection to prevent page reloads on tab/app switch
  - Only reloads on actual auth changes (sign in/out, user switch)
  - Works for both desktop tab switching and mobile app switching
  
- Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md documentation
  - Added project conventions and coding standards
  - Included custom `/progress` command for session summaries
  - Documented feature tracking requirements
  - Added testing and security guidelines
  
- Fixed unwanted scrolling issue
  - Diagnosed consistent scroll behavior when clicking anywhere on page
  - Added global click handler to prevent focus on non-interactive elements
  - Updated tab switching to force scroll to top
  - Added CSS rules to prevent focus-related scrolling
  
- Repository management
  - Reset local branch to match remote after divergence
  - Switched from test-suite-implementation to credit_card_transactions branch
  - Committed and pushed all fixes with detailed commit messages

### Context:
This session focused on fixing two major UX issues that were impacting user experience. The tab refresh issue was causing the application to reload unnecessarily when users switched browser tabs or mobile apps, disrupting their workflow. The scrolling issue was causing the page to jump when clicking anywhere, making the application feel broken. Both issues have been successfully resolved with targeted fixes that maintain all existing functionality while improving the user experience.

### Technical Details:
- Modified `js/modules/supabaseAuth.js` to track previous user ID
- Updated `js/app.js` with global click event handler
- Enhanced `js/modules/ui.js` switchTab function
- Added scroll prevention CSS in `styles.css`

## 2025-07-18 Session Summary (Part 2)

### Accomplishments:
- Fixed credit card payment bug
  - Identified issue with "Debt" category conflicting with credit card accounts
  - Added validation to prevent using "Debt" category with credit card accounts
  - Added helpful error messages guiding users to correct category usage
  - Enhanced debugging for credit card balance updates

- Added "Payment" category for credit card payments
  - Added to transaction form, filter dropdown, and recurring bills
  - Makes it clearer for users to categorize credit card payments

- Alphabetized all category dropdowns
  - Sorted transaction form categories A-Z
  - Sorted transaction filter categories A-Z  
  - Sorted recurring bills categories A-Z
  - Restored accidentally removed categories (Pet Care, Technology, Subscriptions, Savings)

### Context:
User reported a bug where credit card payments were showing confusing confirmation messages and potentially increasing debt instead of decreasing it. Investigation revealed the issue was caused by selecting the "Debt" category when entering credit card transactions, which triggered legacy debt payment logic. The fix prevents this category combination and guides users to use regular categories instead.

### Technical Details:
- Modified `js/modules/transactions.js` to add category validation
- Updated `index.html` to add Payment category and alphabetize all dropdowns
- Added console logging for credit card balance updates to aid debugging
