### Context:
This session was highly productive, completing two major Phase 2 features: Visual Bills Calendar pay schedules and Smart Rules complex conditions/templates. The session also addressed several critical bugs including Smart Rules not processing uncategorized transactions, server port conflicts, and template creation issues. The implementation focused on user experience with intuitive UIs for both pay schedule configuration and rule template selection.

### Technical Details:
- **Pay Schedule Module**: Created paySchedule.js with date calculation algorithms for all frequency types
- **Rule Templates**: Built ruleTemplates.js with 30+ pre-configured rules for common merchants
- **Enhanced Rule Engine**: Updated to support nested condition groups with proper evaluation logic
- **Server Management**: Created Python scripts with process management and port handling
- **UI Components**: Added two new modals (pay schedule and template selector) with responsive designs

### Next on the Todo List:
1. Visual Bills Calendar Phase 3 - Balance projection warnings
2. Cash Flow Forecasting feature
3. Subscription Audit feature  
4. Smart Rules visual condition builder
5. Rule analytics dashboard

## 2025-07-19 Session Summary (Part 2)

### Accomplishments:
- Implemented Visual Bills Calendar (Phase 1) for recurring bills
- Created calendar module with month navigation and event generation
- Built interactive calendar UI with day/event click handlers
- Integrated calendar with existing recurring bills module
- Added toggle between calendar and list views
- Fixed privacy module import error in calendarUI
- Applied dark theme colors to match application design
- Fixed calendar navigation lag and data persistence issues
- Added proper event debouncing and click handling

### Context:
This session focused on implementing the Visual Bills Calendar feature (#14) from the feature roadmap. The calendar provides a visual monthly view of recurring bills with color-coding by category, interactive day details, and quick pay functionality. The implementation addressed several technical challenges including event generation for recurring bills, month navigation with data persistence, and dark theme integration. The calendar is now fully functional and integrated into the recurring bills section of the application.

## 2025-07-19 Session Summary

### Accomplishments:
- **Implemented Smart Rules Engine Phase 1** - Complete automatic transaction processing system
  - Created database schema with RLS policies for multi-tenant security
  - Built pattern matching engine with 12+ operators (contains, equals, greater than, etc.)
  - Developed rule management UI with create/edit/delete functionality
  - Added rule priority system and enable/disable toggles
  - Implemented "Apply to Existing" feature for bulk transaction processing
  
- **Fixed multiple initialization errors** during Smart Rules integration:
  - Added missing `showSuccess` function to ui.js module
  - Fixed incorrect `debug()` calls (changed to `debug.log()`)
  - Replaced direct Supabase calls with proper database wrapper methods
  - Converted eventManager usage to CustomEvent pattern for inter-module communication
  
- **Created comprehensive documentation**:
  - SMART_RULES_GUIDE.md - Complete user guide with examples and best practices
  - Updated feature-ideas.md to mark Smart Rules as implemented
  - Started updating current-features.md with Smart Rules details

### Context:
This session focused on implementing the Smart Rules Engine, a highly requested feature that allows users to automatically process transactions based on customizable patterns. The implementation faced several technical challenges with module imports and event handling, which were systematically identified and resolved using sequential thinking and multi-agent workflows. The result is a fully functional Phase 1 implementation ready for user testing.

### Technical Details:
- **New files created**: smartRules.js, ruleEngine.js, rulesUI.js, categories.js, rules.css, smart_rules_schema.sql
- **Pattern matching**: Supports text operators (contains, equals, starts with, etc.) and numeric operators (greater than, less than, between, etc.)
- **Actions available**: Set category, add tags, add notes (with more planned for Phase 2)
- **Event system**: Migrated from incorrect eventManager usage to standard CustomEvent/dispatchEvent pattern
- **Database integration**: All CRUD operations properly wrapped in FinancialDatabase methods

### Next Steps:
- Integrate Smart Rules with transaction creation flow (auto-process new transactions)
- Write comprehensive tests for rule matching logic
- Begin Phase 2: Complex conditions with AND/OR logic
- Add rule templates for common use cases

## 2025-07-18 Session Summary

### Accomplishments:
- Fixed Supabase authentication tab refresh issue
  - Implemented smart auth state detection to prevent page reloads on tab/app switch
  - Only reloads on actual auth changes (sign in/out, user switch)
  - Works for both desktop tab switching and mobile app switching
  
- Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md documentation
  - Added project conventions and coding standards
  - Included custom `/progress` command for session summaries
  - Documented feature tracking requirements
  - Added testing and security guidelines
  
- Fixed unwanted scrolling issue
  - Diagnosed consistent scroll behavior when clicking anywhere on page
  - Added global click handler to prevent focus on non-interactive elements
  - Updated tab switching to force scroll to top
  - Added CSS rules to prevent focus-related scrolling
  
- Repository management
  - Reset local branch to match remote after divergence
  - Switched from test-suite-implementation to credit_card_transactions branch
  - Committed and pushed all fixes with detailed commit messages

### Context:
This session focused on fixing two major UX issues that were impacting user experience. The tab refresh issue was causing the application to reload unnecessarily when users switched browser tabs or mobile apps, disrupting their workflow. The scrolling issue was causing the page to jump when clicking anywhere, making the application feel broken. Both issues have been successfully resolved with targeted fixes that maintain all existing functionality while improving the user experience.

### Technical Details:
- Modified `js/modules/supabaseAuth.js` to track previous user ID
- Updated `js/app.js` with global click event handler
- Enhanced `js/modules/ui.js` switchTab function
- Added scroll prevention CSS in `styles.css`

## 2025-07-18 Session Summary (Part 2)

### Accomplishments:
- Fixed credit card payment bug
  - Identified issue with "Debt" category conflicting with credit card accounts
  - Added validation to prevent using "Debt" category with credit card accounts
  - Added helpful error messages guiding users to correct category usage
  - Enhanced debugging for credit card balance updates

- Added "Payment" category for credit card payments
  - Added to transaction form, filter dropdown, and recurring bills
  - Makes it clearer for users to categorize credit card payments

- Alphabetized all category dropdowns
  - Sorted transaction form categories A-Z
  - Sorted transaction filter categories A-Z  
  - Sorted recurring bills categories A-Z
  - Restored accidentally removed categories (Pet Care, Technology, Subscriptions, Savings)

### Context:
User reported a bug where credit card payments were showing confusing confirmation messages and potentially increasing debt instead of decreasing it. Investigation revealed the issue was caused by selecting the "Debt" category when entering credit card transactions, which triggered legacy debt payment logic. The fix prevents this category combination and guides users to use regular categories instead.

### Technical Details:
- Modified `js/modules/transactions.js` to add category validation
- Updated `index.html` to add Payment category and alphabetize all dropdowns
- Added console logging for credit card balance updates to aid debugging
