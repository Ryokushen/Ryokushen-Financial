## Tips for Using Voice Commands

1. **Natural Language**: The system understands variations of commands. For example:
   - "What's my balance?" = "Show balance" = "How much money do I have?"

2. **Parameters**: Many commands accept specific parameters:
   - **Time periods**: "this month", "last month", "this week", "yesterday", "today"
   - **Categories**: Any category name from your transactions
   - **Merchant names**: Any merchant name from your transactions
   - **Account/debt names**: Specific account or debt names

3. **Context Awareness**: Commands provide context-specific responses:
   - Visual response cards with relevant data
   - Auto-dismiss after a few seconds
   - Detailed breakdowns where applicable

4. **Privacy Integration**: Voice commands respect privacy mode settings and can control privacy features

5. **Global Access**: Voice commands are available from any page in the application

## Technical Implementation

The voice command system is implemented across multiple modules:
- `voiceCommandEngine.js`: Pattern matching and intent recognition
- `voiceAnalytics.js`: Financial query processing
- `voiceNavigation.js`: Navigation and action handling
- `globalVoiceInterface.js`: Global voice button and coordination
- `voiceResponseSystem.js`: Visual feedback system
- `confirmationDialog.js`: Visual confirmation for voice-parsed transactions
- `nlpParser.js`: Natural language processing for transaction input
- `speechRecognition.js`: Core speech recognition functionality

### Voice Transaction Input Features

When using voice input for transactions, the system provides:
- **Smart Parsing**: Automatically extracts amount, category, description, and date from natural speech
- **Visual Confirmation Dialog**: Before applying parsed data to the form:
  - Shows the original voice input
  - Displays confidence level percentage
  - Allows editing of extracted values
  - Highlights any missing required fields
  - Options to "Apply" directly or "Edit & Apply" for further modifications
- **Fallback Mode**: Low-confidence inputs fall back to simple text entry

## Voice System Architecture

### System Overview
The voice command system in Ryokushen Financial is a sophisticated, multi-component architecture that provides natural language interaction capabilities while maintaining privacy and security standards.

## NLP Capabilities

### Natural Language Processing Engine

#### Pattern Recognition System
The NLP engine uses a sophisticated pattern matching system with:

1. **Intent Patterns**
   - 100+ regex patterns for intent recognition
   - Weighted confidence scoring
   - Multiple pattern variations per intent

2. **Parameter Extraction**
   - Context-aware parameter extraction
   - Support for multiple parameter types:
     - Categories
     - Time periods
     - Merchants
     - Amounts
     - Account references

3. **Confidence Calculation**
   ```
   confidence = baseConfidence * matchRatio * contextBoost
   ```
   - Base confidence: Intent-specific baseline
   - Match ratio: Percentage of command matched
   - Context boost: Additional confidence from context

### NLP Parser Features

#### Amount Recognition
- **Numeric formats**: "$50", "50 dollars", "fifty dollars"
- **Written numbers**: "twenty-five", "one hundred"
- **Decimal support**: "50.25", "twenty-five point five zero"
- **Range**: 0 to 100,000 (configurable)
