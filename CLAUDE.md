## CRITICAL: Feature Documentation Requirements

### When implementing ANY new feature:
1. **Check `feature-ideas.md`** - If the feature is listed there, mark it as implemented
2. **Update `current-features.md`** - Add the new feature with full details
3. **If feature is not in `feature-ideas.md`** - Add it there first, then mark as implemented

### Feature Documentation Format:
```markdown
### Feature Name âœ… IMPLEMENTED [Date]
- Original description...
- Implementation details...
```

## Preparation Guidelines

### Pre-Code Change Workflow
- **IMPORTANT**: Before making any code changes:
  - Thoroughly review `current-features.md` to understand existing project status
  - Check `feature-ideas.md` to identify planned features
  - Examine `progress.md` to understand recent developments and context
  - Verify current project state to prevent redundant work or conflicting implementations

## Frequently Used Commands

### Development Server
```bash
python3 server.py  # Start local dev server on port 8080
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:unit        # Run unit tests only
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests only
npm run test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Code Quality & Formatting
```bash
npm run lint              # Check code for linting issues
npm run lint:fix          # Auto-fix linting issues where possible
npm run format            # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check      # Check if code formatting is correct
```

### Git Operations
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -10
git diff
```

## Code Quality Standards

### ESLint and Prettier Configuration
The project uses ESLint for code quality and Prettier for consistent formatting:

- **ESLint Configuration**: `eslint.config.js` - Modern flat config format
- **Prettier Configuration**: `.prettierrc` - Consistent code formatting
- **Key Standards**:
  - ES2022+ syntax with module imports
  - Single quotes for strings
  - 2-space indentation
  - 100 character line width
  - Semicolons required
  - Browser-first environment (window, document, etc.)

### Running Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Before committing code, always run:
npm run lint:fix    # Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run format      # Format all code consistently

# To check without making changes:
npm run lint        # Check for linting issues only
npm run format:check # Check formatting without changing files
```

### ESLint Rules Summary
- **Errors**: Critical issues that must be fixed (syntax errors, undefined variables)
- **Warnings**: Code quality suggestions (unused variables, prefer const, etc.)
- **Auto-fixable**: Most formatting and simple style issues
- **Manual fixes**: Logic errors, unused variables, accessibility issues
