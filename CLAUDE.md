## CRITICAL: Feature Documentation Requirements

### When implementing ANY new feature:
1. **Check `feature-ideas.md`** - If the feature is listed there, mark it as implemented
2. **Update `current-features.md`** - Add the new feature with full details
3. **If feature is not in `feature-ideas.md`** - Add it there first, then mark as implemented

### Feature Documentation Format:
```markdown
### Feature Name âœ… IMPLEMENTED [Date]
- Original description...
- Implementation details...
```

## Preparation Guidelines

### Pre-Code Change Workflow
- **IMPORTANT**: Before making any code changes:
  - Thoroughly review `current-features.md` to understand existing project status
  - Check `feature-ideas.md` to identify planned features
  - Examine `progress.md` to understand recent developments and context
  - Verify current project state to prevent redundant work or conflicting implementations
